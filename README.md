# Programming Robot Labs
01/12/2020

Labs for students taking Programming or Introduction to Computer Science. Built on Rev. Douglas Oberle's Robot Labs at W.T. Woodson High.
___
Rev. Oberle's labs are a modified version of TJHSST's Intro to Computer Science assignments.

These labs were created to provide an alternative to the traditional Robot labs at Woodson High School. Both 'Programming' and 'Introduction to Computer Science' classes utilize the regular Robot Labs despite being different tiered classes. The goal is that these labs help students with prior HTML/Javscript knowledge learn Java quickly. While students without any programming knowledge are welcome to use these labs, it's recommended that the instructor provide lectures in addition to the labs in that case.
___

This repository contains the robot lab documents, shell files for the students, and a set of completed labs.
